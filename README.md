# Novel Techniques for Process Topology Reconstruction and Fault Diagnosis (PTR-FD)

This repository contains the codebases for the three PTR-FD algorithms investigated in my MASc thesis. The three algorithms include:

1. Granger Causality
2. Granger Net
3. Extended Convergent Cross-Mapping

To use this repo, first clone it.

Next, install external module dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A guide on how to use these functions provided in `packages` can be found using the Jupyter Notebook `Quickstart.ipynb`.
